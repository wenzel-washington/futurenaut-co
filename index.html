            <div class="about-content">
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>Hello, I'm Wenzel â€“ like Denzel Washington, but with a W. At 40 years old, I've never worked a day for anyone but myself. I'm a self-made entrepreneur, crypto enthusiast, AI advocate, and a firm believer in working smart, not hard.</p>
                    
                    <p>The phrase "LazyButRich" perfectly encapsulates my approach to life and work. But don't let the "lazy" fool you â€“ it's not about avoiding work, but about finding the most efficient path to success. For me, being "rich" isn't just about money; it's about having the freedom to control my time and live life on my own terms.</p>
                    
                    <h3>My Journey</h3>
                    <p>I attended a business school in Germany, finding it quite interesting. This led me to the University of Heidelberg to study business further. However, within the first month, I realized that traditional academia wasn't for me.</p>
                    
                    <p>Fortune favored me early on. I had already started running a small affiliate marketing website, which, while not hugely profitable, showed me the potential of making money online. This realization was the push I needed to make a bold decision â€“ I dropped out of college.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since that day in September 2004, I've been self-employed and never looked back.</p>

                    <h3>Online Marketing</h3>
                    <p>I discovered early on the importance of not trading time for money. Through affiliate marketing, I built systems that earned money around the clock, benefiting from passive income and geographic independence.</p>

                <div class="pillar">
                    <h3>Cryptocurrencies</h3>
                    <p>My journey into crypto began in 2016 when a friend convinced me to buy Bitcoin. While I missed some earlier opportunities, this experience taught me the value of asymmetric bets â€“ small investments with potentially high returns. Since then, I've built a following of 13,000 on Twitter/X, sharing my insights on crypto.</p>

                    <h3>Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                    <p>I believe the next decade will see a significant increase in innovation driven by large language models and AI. For the past 1.5 years, I've dedicated myself to learning as much as possible about this rapidly evolving field. I'm particularly interested in how AI can be used for automation and scaling businesses without traditional employment structures.</p>
