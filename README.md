# 🚀 Futurenaut.co

The official digital base station of Wenzel — entrepreneur, crypto native, AI explorer, and lifelong independent thinker. This project serves as my central hub on the web: portfolio, playground, and launchpad for everything I’m building and learning.

## 🌌 Project Purpose

I created futurenaut.co to document and showcase my projects across crypto, AI, automation, and digital business. But it's also more than a website — it's part of an ongoing mission to learn modern development workflows, understand Git/GitHub deeply, and build in public.

With the help of ChatGPT (GPT-4 Turbo, April 2025), I'm using a space exploration theme and gamification system to make learning fun and structured — turning each task into a mission log as I navigate the GitHub Galaxy.
